# About-Me
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm here to sharpen my programming skills, explore web development, and experiment with internet interactions. Along the way, I aim to share my projects and ideas, hoping they might be useful to others.

Certifications:
I hold the following certifications:
Certificate III in Information and Communications Technology at TAFE Qld
Certificate IV in Cyber Security at TAFE Qld
TryHackMe Certifications: Various achievements on TryHackMe â€“ https://tryhackme.com/p/B1tf1ip0R

Current Focus:
I'm currently diving into website development. While my courses covered the basics, I felt I needed more hands-on experience to truly understand how everything connects on a functional level. My first project here is a multi-page static website, and I'm planning to explore a Django framework project next.

Professional Experience:
I run a small IT business that provides repair and troubleshooting services for home users. Although it's not widely advertised yet, it's been a great way to apply my skills practically.

Career Goals:
I'm seeking opportunities in IT that involve technical problem-solving while leveraging my strengths in customer service and administration. If you're looking for someone with a mix of technical expertise and people skills, feel free to reach out on the email below!

Happy coding! ðŸš€

Cheers,
